# hugo-uswds

An open-source implementation of the [The United States Web Design System (USWDS) 2.2.1](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) open-source static site generator.

Implementation of the USWDS is currently incomplete, but suffecient to support a number of websites hosted at NIST. [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) to improve this project are welcome.

This project has been tested on HUGO version >= [0.58.3](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/latest) and requires a `hugo-extended` build with pipe and SCSS generation support. Installation [instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) for common platforms are available in the Hugo [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/l).
